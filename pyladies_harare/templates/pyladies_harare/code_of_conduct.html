         <p>Pyladies is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or 
                bullying of any community member in any form. This does not only extend to members to local PyLadies communities, 
                but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the larger PyLadies community of users, developers and integrators 
                through events or interactions.</p>

           <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or 
                  comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or 
                  recording, sustained disruption of talks, IRC chats, electronic meetings, physical meetings or other events, 
                  inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or
                  bullying behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>
              
           <p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, representatives of the community may take reasonable action they deem 
                  appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any PyLadies event, or expulsion from mailing lists, 
                  discussion boards and other electronic communications channels to resolve the issue. This may include expulsion from 
                  PyLadies Meetup group membership.</p>
              
           <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please act to intercede
                  or ask for help from any member of the PyLadies community, website admins, or organizers/representatives of any physical
                  events put on under the auspices of PyLadies. </p> </div>
